## Monorepo Layout
The codebase is structured in a monorepo-like format for scalability:
```
â”œâ”€â”€ apps/          # Contains the main applications
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ styled/      # Main app built with styled-component (legacy)
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ tailwind/    # Main app built with Tailwind CSS V4 & Electron renderer process
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ electron/    # Electron main & preload process
â”œâ”€â”€ public/        # Sharing public resources
â”œâ”€â”€ packages/      # Shared libraries or utilities
```


## Project Structure
```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ api/           # API modules and abstractions
â”œâ”€â”€ components/    # Reusable UI components
â”œâ”€â”€ hooks/         # Custom React hooks
â”œâ”€â”€ pages/         # Route-level components
â”œâ”€â”€ store/         # RTK store and slices
â”œâ”€â”€ types/         # TypeScript type definitions
